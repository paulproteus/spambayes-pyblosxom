<description>Hello Asheesh,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I came to your site via Slashdot's story about key collisions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I saw this page, I had to read, it's something I am careful about (ethics of where I spend my money). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1) Thanks for reminding me of local group Adbusters' shoes, I'd completely forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2) On CBC's Dragons' Den a guy who makes shoes in Africa made a presentation.  They seem like quite nice shoes -- hopefully I'll get a pair one of these days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may be interested in them yourself, so, as someone with &lt;b&gt;no affiliations&lt;/b&gt; to them, I'll pass along the company:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oliberte.com"&gt;Oliberté Shoes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Why Made in Africa? This is Africa.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what’s with this whole Africa thing people ask us sometimes. It’s simple, Oliberté is about creating a better Africa, that people see differently. And we do it by creating premium shoes, made of the highest quality possible working with amazing people – all in Africa.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
